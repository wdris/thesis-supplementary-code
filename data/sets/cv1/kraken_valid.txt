/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/300-23.png	informing me that all was peaceable

/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/301-31.png	was down; who said that that objection to

/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/302-10.png	nothing else. I should be glad your Honor
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/302-11.png	would direct what is to be done in these ca-

/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/302-25.png	and the Borders of Carolina" I am confident,
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/302-26.png	men might be had there. Your Honor
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/302-27.png	never having given any particular Directi-
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/302-28.png	ons about the Provisions; I should be glad to
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/302-29.png	know, whether you would have more laid in
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/302-30.png	than what will serve for twelve hundred men;
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/302-31.png	that I may give orders accordingly.
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/302-32.png	As I can not now conceive, that

/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-04.png	be so serviceable as riding from place making the

/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-06.png	saries are forwarded up with dispatch. I there-
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-07.png	fore think it advisable to inform your Honour
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-08.png	of it, hoping that it will correspond with your own opinion.
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-09.png	I forgot to mention when I was down, that Mr. Living-
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-10.png	ston, the Fort - Major, was appointed adjutant to our
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-11.png	Regiment" - I knew of none else whose long servitude
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-12.png	in a military way, had qualified better for the office,
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-13.png	he was appointed the 17th. of September.
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-14.png	Captain Mercer's pay, as aid de camp,
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-15.png	seems yet doubtful; I should be glad if your Honour
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-16.png	would fix it" so is Captain Stewarts" If Captain Stew-
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-17.png	arts is encreased, I suppose all the Officers belonging
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-18.png	to the Light Horse will expect to have theirs augmen-
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-19.png	ted also. Colonel Stephens, in a late letter, dis-
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-20.png	covered an inclination to go to the Creek and Che-
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-21.png	rokee Indians this Winter. I told him where to ap-
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-22.png	ply, if he had any such thoughts. I believe, on
/Users/ad168613/Desktop/GW_Project/data/line_images_normalized/303-23.png	so useful a Business, he might be spared until
